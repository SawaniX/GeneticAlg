## Genetic algorithm for finding path
***
### Environment:

In the 'game.py' file we can find source code with environment and robot. It is created with PyGame library, we can easily add, remove and change room parameters, like walls and obstacles.

### Algorithm:

In the *genetic_algorithm.py* file we can find source code of genetic algorithm used for finding the best path.
